The Principle States that class/module/package should have single responsibility, It means it should have a single reason to be
changed.
For suppose, you have a payment system which makes payment, but along with it also sends email invoice to the person email id.
Here, Payment class has two reasons to be changed.

1. Logic change in payment/transaction
2. In the future, we can change logic of sendInvoiceToEmail method.
Thus, It violates the principle of Single Responsibility principle.

For getting rid of above issue, we can create another class which is only responsible for sending email and attachments.
Thus, we can follow Single responsibility principle.

### Pros of Using the Single Responsibility Principle
- This principle lets us focus on assigning only one responsibility to a class. Suppose, your class is assigned multiple 
 responsibilities, but in the future change in one responsibility might break the entire class functionality.
- Using the principle in code can make it more readable, easily testable, and extendable.

### Cons of Using the Single Responsibility Principle
- Creating a class for each of the responsibilities can lead creation of a lot of small classes in the project. 
  If the project is large, it becomes a headache to manage all the classes with their test code.
